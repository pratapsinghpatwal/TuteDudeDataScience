## ðŸ§  Tumor Detection - Project Summary

This project focuses on detecting whether a tumor is **begining** or **malignant** using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and applying classification algorithms to the Tumor_Detection dataset. The goal is to build an accurate model that can assist in early tumor diagnosis using key features like radius, texture, and area of the tumor.
