# 🌧️Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict rainfall based on historical weather data using machine learning techniques. Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agricultural planning, disaster management, and effective water resource utilization.


## 🧠 Objective
To build a predictive model that forecasts rainfall levels based on various climatic features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## 📊 Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy for data manipulation
- matplotlib, seaborn for visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning models and metrics
